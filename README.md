## Database Structure

The image below displays an entity relationship diagram (ERD) showing the structure of the database in the application.

As shown in the ERD, the app models a many-to-many relationship between the letters and numbers in the entry code. This is due to the fact that any three numbers can be combined with any three letters to form the entry-code. In addition, many numbers can be present in a single entry code and so can many letters. Conversely, only one entry code can result in a big prize and many entry codes can be unsuccessful in gaining a prize. However, ten entries can earn a small proze

The board was split into three sections: "To do", "In Progress" and "Done". The "To do" section contains the elements that were planned but not initiated. The "In Progress" section contains the entries that were being worked on. Elements were generally worked on two at a time. However, the element(s) in the "To do" section would stay there if the element that was situated in the "In Progress" section was required to be completed for that to occur. Any elements that were finalised were placed in the "Done" section. Each element contained the user story described the need of the user for that element and the tasks required to accomplish it.
